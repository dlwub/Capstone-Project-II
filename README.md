# An API based movie app

> This project is a second Capstone project at Microverse. The movie web app is built based on two external APIs: the TVmaze API ('[https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/]') and the Involvement API ('[https://us-central1-involvement-api.cloudfunctions.net/capstoneApi/]). The web app has two user interfaces: a home page that displays list of movies and a popup window with more detail for each movie.
